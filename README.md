# DoorSensor_TempSensor
This is my code for my particle photon that has a reed switch attached to my door. In addition my photon board has a relay switch that turns on or off depending on the temepture in the room. 

##### Note
The commented code is due to me trying reverse engineer a RF remote for my ceiling fan so please ignore.
